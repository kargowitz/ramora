# Ramora
Ramora, my attempt to build an ACTUAL OS, or a base for another one. Usually I build these for personal reasons, but now I am releasing a test OS, using methods I normally wouldn't.

# More info!

## Ramora

Ramora is a hobbyist operating system built from scratch, designed with a unique memory management model and a lightweight, efficient kernel. This is perfect for enthusiasts exploring low-level computing, OS development, and bare-metal programming.

## Features

Custom Memory Management – Track memory in sectors and blocks, giving you fine-grained control. (**WIP!! Certainly a strange approach I chose but eh I'll still do it**)

Inode filesystem – Inspired by Unix inodes for a flexible, persistent file system design. (Also WIP lol)

Bare-Metal Friendly – Designed for direct hardware access and experimentation.

Lightweight Kernel – Minimal footprint for rapid prototyping and testing. (Like 10KB compiled)

QEMU Compatible – Easily test and run in virtualized environments.

Why Ramora?

Ramora is a platform for curious developers who want to explore how operating systems work under the hood.
It also has unorthodox approaches to memory managment and video.
